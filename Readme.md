# ToDoList project
- Based on Python Mega Course (by Ardit Sulce)
  - First 20 lessons on building a Todo List app
  - Includes command line, desktop GUI , and web versions
 
- Three separate implementations 
  - course.C is from working the lessons
  - mikeb.M is enhanced implementation based on my own ideas and those of others on the internet
  - ChatGTP.A is experiments in generating code similiar to course.C and mikeb.M
  - (C,M,A - are the letters that proceed git commit comments and correspond to the respective implementations)

- Github repo: https://github.com/mikebstudy/PMC.01.ToDoList
  - each version is in its own folder 

## course.C
- Versions from course first 20 lessons
- Not all lessons were viewed, just enough to get the gist and do the projects
 
### Departures from course version
- Misc coding changes and variable naming changes that did not affect functionality
- Added clear command
- Changed complete command to done command
- Added number check validation to edit and done commands

### Notes

#### GUI
- Day 16: 152 Create a Desktop Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
- Day 18: 177 ... Creating a Standalone Executable
- pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --clean gui.py
  - Generated output that had malware in it as detected by norton

#### Git, Github (mostly in PyCharm)
- helpful Day 15: 147 ... Using Git
- helpful Day 16: 157 ... Using Github
- helpful Day 17: 167 ... Clone a Remote Github Repository

#### Web Deployment 
- streamlit web deployment not used
  - See 184 Deploying the Web App to the Cloud
  - Good for deployment for simple easy apps like ToDo list
  - Deploys to share.streamlit.io/reponamefilepath/filename.py
- demo of deployment to Heroku
  - See 188 ... Web App Deployment
  - I checked pricing - about $7/mo for minimal plan that runs continuously
